# Interview Scheduler

Built in React.js, Interview Scheduler allows users and interviewers to connect for appointments Monday to Friday. Users can add, reschedule, or cancel appointments with the interviewer of their choice, all with the click of the mouse or tap of the finger.

This is a learning project created as part of the education curriculum at Lighthouse Labs.
